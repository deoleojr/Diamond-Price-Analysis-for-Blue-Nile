## Synopsis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of over 1,000 diamonds to explore how price is related to other variables such as carat, clarity, color, and cut. The analysis includes creating visualizations to understand these relationships and fitting a simple linear regression model of price against carat. The project aims to address claims made on the Blue Nile diamond education page and provide insights for potential customers.
